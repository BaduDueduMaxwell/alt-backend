# 0x03. Queuing System in JS

## Back-end Development with JavaScript, Redis, NodeJS, ExpressJS, and Kue

### Project Overview

This project is part of the back-end development course and focuses on building a queuing system using technologies such as **JavaScript**, **NodeJS**, **ExpressJS**, **Redis**, and **Kue**. The system will involve running a Redis server, utilizing Kue as a queue system, and building a basic Express application that interacts with Redis for storing and processing data.

---

### **Learning Objectives**

At the end of this project, you will be able to explain to anyone, without the help of Google:

- How to run a Redis server on your machine
- How to run simple operations with the Redis client
- How to use a Redis client with NodeJS for basic operations
- How to store hash values in Redis
- How to deal with async operations with Redis
- How to use Kue as a queue system
- How to build a basic Express app interacting with a Redis server
- How to build a basic Express app interacting with both a Redis server and queue system

---

### **Project Requirements**

- All code will be compiled/interpreted on **Ubuntu 18.04**, **Node 12.x**, and **Redis 5.0.7**.
- All files should end with a new line.
- A `README.md` file is mandatory and should be placed at the root of the project folder.
- Your code should use the `.js` extension.
- **Required Files**:
  - `package.json`
  - `.babelrc`
- Donâ€™t forget to run `npm install` to install all necessary dependencies.

### **Installation and Setup**

1. **Install Dependencies:**
   After cloning the repository, navigate to the project folder and install the required dependencies:
   ```bash
   npm install
   ```

2. **Install Redis:**
   Follow the Redis [installation guide](https://redis.io/docs/getting-started/) to install Redis on your local machine or server.

3. **Run Redis Server:**
   Start the Redis server using the following command:
   ```bash
   src/redis-server &
   ```

4. **Run the Express Application:**
   To start the Node.js server, run:
   ```bash
   node app.js
   ```

5. **Using the Redis Client with NodeJS:**
   In your NodeJS app, use the Redis client to interact with Redis and perform basic operations like setting and getting values.

### **How to Run the Project**

1. **Start Redis:**
   Make sure Redis is running on your local machine by using:
   ```bash
   src/redis-server &
   ```

2. **Run the Express Application:**
   After installing the dependencies, you can start the Node.js application by running:
   ```bash
   node src/app.js
   ```
